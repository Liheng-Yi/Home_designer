Home Designer is an interior design firm that specializes in client communication and automation. Currently, the firm has 100+ clients meaning that our system will need to be capable of handling roughly 50-200 new client records per year. This is assuming some level of growth or stagnation in new client numbers. The website will record clientsâ€™ personal and contact information, project information, billing hours, and employee information. The website helps employees, managers, and clients keep a close eye on the time and money spent on projects. The idea is for there to be a single consolidated place for the business to view and manage its operations. The firm is currently working on 800+ projects with about 250 employees. Again this means that our system will need to handle a moderate employee turnover (50 new employees per year).
